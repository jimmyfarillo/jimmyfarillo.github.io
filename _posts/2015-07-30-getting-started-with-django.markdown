A couple weeks ago, I started learning Python. There are a few reasons I chose
Python as the next language I wanted to learn after learning JavaScript. These
were criteria:

- Python is used in web development
- Python has true classes, unlike JS, resulting in real object-oriented
  programming
- There are many many jobs available for Python developers
- The design of Python seems well thought out compared to JavaScript
- Python syntax and forced indentation results in neatly structured code

I started my learning by delving into the Python track on
[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). For learning new coding
concepts/technologies, I prefer learning by videos and short exercises over
using books. If you are the same, I highly suggest checking out
[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) or [Code
School](https://www.codeschool.com/) or any of the other similar sites. They
can be a great way to jumpstart your learning.

After tackling the Python track on Treehouse, I completed a smattering of
problems on both [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) and
[CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/). These sites are awesome for developing
strong fundamentals in a particular programming language.

Honestly, I still feel fairly weak in Python. But I do know the basics, and I
feel confident that I can effectively Google my way through most problems. I
also feel that I learn best when building things. How else can you come across
real world problems and find ways to solve them?

On Monday of this week, I decided to start a Django tutorial. I chose Django
because it is, from what I can tell, the most popular Python web framework and
it is supposed to have great documentation. I started the tutorial on the
official Django website:

[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/]

My only experience with web development is with full stack JavaScript, so the
idea of setting up my Django application was a bit daunting. Thankfully, this
tutorial walks you through every step needed to setup your first Django
application, including linking to other tutorials where it might be necessary.
There are 6 parts to the tutorial, and I have completed the first 2 parts. Here
are a few tips if you are getting started with Python and Django:

- Follow this guide for installing Python 3 on your Mac:
  [http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how-to-upgrade-your-mac-to-python-3]
- Follow this guide for `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`:
  [http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/]
- If you have issues with `virtualenvwrapper`, try using `easy_install` instead
  of `pip3`. This solved a problem I had when trying to perform `source
  /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`.
