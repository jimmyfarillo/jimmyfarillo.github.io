            The Basics of Database Indexes for Relational Databases
          </a>
        </h3><p>The purpose of creating an index on a particular table in your database is to
make it faster to search through the table and find the row or rows that you
want. The downside is that indexes make it slower to add rows or make updates to
existing rows for that table. So adding indexes can increase read performance
and decrease write performance. Indexes are also used to enforce uniqueness
constraints, but I wonâ€™t go into that for this post.</p>

one-day conference with the aim of helping to create a more inclusive tech
industry. There were many great talks throughout the day as the speakers shared
their inspiring stories and delved into thought-provoking topics, including:</p>

<a href="/2017/02/19/learn-design-patterns-template-method-pattern.html">template method pattern</a>
I wrote about in my previous post, providing a different solution to the common
programming problem of requiring some variation within an algorithm. Both
patterns use polymorphism in their approaches, but while the template method
pattern relies on inheritance, the strategy pattern relies on composition and
delegation.</p>

        </h3><p>A couple friends and I have a web development book club. The goal is to learn
and grow together as software engineers. But really, sometimes itâ€™s more like a
support group, where we use a lot of ðŸ˜ž and ðŸ˜¢ to discuss our respective
screw-ups at work and the impossible vastness of information about web
development and how we only know the smallest tiniest minusculest amount of it.
Weâ€™re a fun groupâ€¦</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>At some point during your career as a web developer, you will have to decide
what type of database is best suited for your application. You might face this
decision very soon, if you are planning on building your own application as a
side project. And at the very least, you will probably be asked about databases
in a job interview for a web developer role.</p>

reviews are an important part of the job. It is probably the one duty of my job
that I can expect to do every single day. Why? What is the purpose of code
reviews? Well, code reviews have several purposes. They:</p>

bore you with the whole story of why or how I did it. Find any other millennial
