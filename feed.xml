make it faster to search through the table and find the row or rows that you
want. The downside is that indexes make it slower to add rows or make updates to
existing rows for that table. So adding indexes can increase read performance
and decrease write performance. Indexes are also used to enforce uniqueness
constraints, but I won’t go into that for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-first-lets-talk-about-karaoke&quot;&gt;But First, Let’s Talk About Karaoke!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being my favorite pastime (just FYI, I’m Filipino), karaoke provides a
good analogy for indexes and might help you when reading the rest of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All karaoke joints I’ve been to provide songbooks that contain the list of songs
you can sing. The pages are organized like a database table, usually with 3
columns: song title, artist, and code. The code is what you enter into the
system to bring up the karaoke track. And there are usually two songbooks: one
sorted by artist name and one sorted by song title. That way you can either
think of an artist you want to sing and then look through their songs, or look
up a specific song title you know you want to sing or in case you don’t know the
artist’s name. These songbooks are like indexes for the database of songs. They
provide a sorted list of data that is easily searchable by relevant information.
There isn’t an index for the code column because that information is not
relevant information that you would search by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to actual databases…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-indexes-increase-read-performance&quot;&gt;How Do Indexes Increase Read Performance?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the primary key column of a particular table. It is usually the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;
column, and it is usually a digit that increments with each new row in the
table. So when you try to retrieve a specific row from the database using its
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, the database doesn’t need to search through every single row to find the
one you’re asking for; the data is already sorted and can be searched using
efficient algorithms. Even if you were to rearrange the rows in the table so
that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; column was unsorted, the primary key column of tables is
automatically indexed, meaning there is a copy of that column with the sorted
data that the database will use to search. And that index contains pointers to
the actual rows in the table, so once it has found the correct &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; from that
copied data, it knows exactly where to find the rest of the information for that
row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indexes on columns that are not the primary key column work in the same way. For
example, you might have an articles table in your database that contains columns
for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the primary key &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;.
Depending on how you query for data in your application, you might want to add
indexes on some of these columns to improve read performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your application has a feature where you can search for articles by their
title, it might be wise to put an index on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; column. This will create
a copy of that column where all the articles’ titles are sorted. Maybe your
application also allows users to view articles from a specific time period that
they define. Instead of the database having to check every single row’s
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/code&gt; column, you can put an index on that column, and the database
will be able to easily find the articles that were published in that time frame
because they will all be right next to each other. However, it seems unnecessary
(and a bit ridiculous) to put on index on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; column because your
application is unlikely to query the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt; table by the full contents of
each article. (There are much better ways to search through large bodies of text
in databases.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indexes can also be useful for foreign key columns when dealing with
associations. Let’s say the articles table also contains an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt; column
that corresponds to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; column on the users table. If you put an index on
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt; column, when you query the database for all the articles by a
particular author, the results can be found much faster because all articles by
that author will be grouped together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;indexes-on-multiple-columns&quot;&gt;Indexes On Multiple Columns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also create a single index from multiple columns in a table. Extending
the example from above, maybe your application allows authors to view their own
articles, and the default view is to show them in reverse chronological order.
On your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt; table, it would make sense to create an index using both the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/code&gt; columns. Here’s a diagram of how you might think
about that index:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;| author_id | published_at |
|-----------|--------------|
|           | 2017-08-17   |
|     1     | 2017-08-20   |
|           | 2017-08-22   |
|-----------|--------------|
|           | 2017-08-14   |
|           | 2017-08-20   |
|     2     | 2017-08-21   |
|           | 2017-08-22   |
|           | 2017-08-23   |
|-----------|--------------|
|     3     | 2017-08-01   |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when querying the database for all the articles by an author and ordered by
their &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/code&gt; dates, the database can use this index to quickly retrieve
the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating an index from multiple columns, it is important that you specify
the correct order of the columns. The above index was created by first
specifying the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt; column and then the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;published_at&lt;/code&gt; column. Had it
been reversed, the index would not be nearly as useful for the page we want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;| published_at | author_id |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2017-08-01   | 3         |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2017-08-07   | 3         |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2017-08-14   | 2         |
|              | 3         |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2017-08-17   | 1         |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2017-08-20   | 1         |
|              | 2         |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2017-08-21   | 2         |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2017-08-22   | 1         |
|              | 2         |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2017-08-23   | 2         |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating an index, you want the database to be able to eliminate as many
items as possible for at each step of its search. In the first example, after
finding the appropriate &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt;, all other rows for other authors are
eliminated, and the database then just has to search through a handful of
remaining rows. The second index is not even usable for our purposes of showing
a single author’s articles in reverse chronology because there is no way to
effectively search through the indexed data. So keep in mind the column order
that will create the index that will be most beneficial to your database
queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-indexes-decrease-write-performance&quot;&gt;How Do Indexes Decrease Write Performance?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of improving database read times using indexes is that write times
suffer. Adding a new row to a table without indexes is simple. The database
finds the next available space in the table to add the new entry and adds it,
that’s it. However, when adding a new row to a table with one or more indexes,
the database adds the new entry to the table, and then it has to add a new entry
into each index on that table, making sure to insert the entry into the correct
spot in the index to ensure that the data is properly sorted. And this
performance degradation applies to creates, updates, and deletes for the table.
For this reason, adding unnecessary indexes on tables should be avoided, and
indexes that are no longer used should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding indexes is about improving performance of search queries. Maybe the goal
of your database is to provide a data store that is often written to and rarely
read from. If that is the case, decreasing the performance of the more common
operation, writing, is probably not worth the increase in performance you get
from reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The purpose of creating an index on a particular table in your database is to make it faster to search through the table and find the row or rows that you want.

one-day conference with the aim of helping to create a more inclusive tech
industry. There were many great talks throughout the day as the speakers shared
their inspiring stories and delved into thought-provoking topics, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designing ethically-conscious products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potential problems with the way tech companies express how they value their
employees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to empower so-called “quiet developers”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One talk stood out to me for its simplicity and message of “fostering healthy
communication on small teams”. The speaker was Rachel Vincent, the Head of
Operations at The Recurse Center, which provides educational programming
retreats in NYC. In Rachel’s talk, she highlighted the social rules that her
team has adopted that help ensure they communicate with each other in efficient,
honest, and non-harmful ways. These are the four social rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-feigning-surprise&quot;&gt;No Feigning Surprise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Really?! You don’t know about… ?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule is about not acting surprised when a person shares that they don’t
know about something. This type of reaction adds no benefit to the conversation
and can often lead to making the person feel bad or insecure for not knowing
about the topic. Furthermore, in an industry like tech where people are
constantly learning, it is important for people to feel comfortable admitting
that they don’t know something to their colleagues. When people feign surprise
at such an admission, it can inhibit the learning process for that individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-well-actuallys&quot;&gt;No Well-Actuallys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A: “Beethoven’s Symphony №5 is probably his most famous work, and he was 38
years old when he finished it. It’s my favorite of his, especially the second
movement.”
B: “Well, actually he was 37 years old.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-actually is when someone corrects (often by interruption) an
insignificant fact stated by another person. While it is always important to
convey accurate information, being corrected on small details is not beneficial
to the actual topic being discussed. These minor corrections do not serve
truth-seeking. Corrections that do provide real clarification to the
conversation and are not given with a disguised yearning for admiration are, of
course, always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-backseat-driving&quot;&gt;No Backseat Driving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A: “Maybe running that rake task again will fix it.”
B: “I tried running it 5 times already.”
C: “Just clear the cache!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backseat driving is when a conversation is happening between two or more people
and someone attempts to interject with their own advice. In most cases, that
individual does not have the full information to be providing useful advice and
ends up slowing down the individuals actually engaged in the conversation. It is
most efficient (and least annoying) to fully engage in the conversation first
before offering advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-subtle-isms&quot;&gt;No Subtle-isms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s so easy my grandmother could do it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subtle-ism is a statement with underlying, often unintentional, tones of
sexism, racism, homophobia, or other similar biases that can make others feel
uncomfortable or unwelcome. The last thing we want to do is make someone feel
bad for various aspects about their lifestyle and/or identity, even if that was
not the intention of the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to lie, I have definitely broken all of these rules before, and I
am sure that I will continue to break them. I’m not perfect. But my hope is that
by keeping these rules in mind during both my personal and professional
communications, I can become better at identifying when I break them so that I
can apologize, correct myself, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also highly encourage anyone who is interested to attend an AlterConf event.
They take place throughout the year in cities across the world, the tickets are
fairly inexpensive for a tech conference (basic tickets were $25 for the event
I attended), and the mission of the conference is quite admirable and important
in our largely homogenous, oftentimes uninviting industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a big thanks to my friend &amp;amp; coworker Melissa Moy for urging me to attend
this event!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This weekend I attended my first AlterConf, a one-day conference with the aim of helping to create a more inclusive tech industry.

&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/19/learn-design-patterns-template-method-pattern.html&quot;&gt;template method pattern&lt;/a&gt;
I wrote about in my previous post, providing a different solution to the common
programming problem of requiring some variation within an algorithm. Both
patterns use polymorphism in their approaches, but while the template method
pattern relies on inheritance, the strategy pattern relies on composition and
delegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;composition&quot;&gt;Composition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; example from the post on the template method pattern, you
might choose to think about parties as being made up of different parts, such as
a venue, guests, supplies, and activities. Modeled in code, these parts could be
defined as instance variables with accessor methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Party
  attr_accessor :venue, :guests, :supplies, :activities

  def initialize(args)
    @venue = args[:venue]
    @guests = args[:guests]
    @supplies = args[:supplies]
    @activities = args[:activities]
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composition describes the “has a” relationship between the object and the parts
that it is made up of. From this perspective, a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; “has a” &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;venue&lt;/code&gt;, “has a”
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;guests&lt;/code&gt;, “has a” &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;supplies&lt;/code&gt;, and “has a” &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;activities&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast with inheritance, which describes a “is a” relationship. A
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BirthdayParty&lt;/code&gt; “is a” &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So another way to look at the different types a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; could be is to think
about them in terms of their parts. Here’s an example of a birthday party and a
game night party implemented using composition rather than inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Party
  attr_accessor :venue, :guests, :supplies, :activities

  def initialize(args)
    @venue = args[:venue]
    @guests = args[:guests]
    @supplies = args[:supplies]
    @activities = args[:activities]
  end
end

birthday_party = Party.new(
  venue: Place.new(&quot;Chuck E. Cheese's&quot;),
  guests: [User.new('Margaret Atwood'), User.new('David Mitchell')],
  supplies: [Food.new('birthday cake')],
  activities: [Activity.new('sing happy birthday')]
)

game_night = Party.new(
  venue: Place.new('246 Maple Lane'),
  guests: [User.new('Ruth Ozeki'), User.new('Kazuo Ishiguro')],
  supplies: [Game.new('Catan'), Game.new('Bananagrams')],
  activities: [Activity.new('play games')]
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, each instance of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; is instantiated with different parts.
Specifically, the array supplies for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;birthday_party&lt;/code&gt; contains a single object
of type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;game_night&lt;/code&gt; contains two objects of type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Game&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll
come back to this example below, when we get into the specifics of the strategy
pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of defining different kinds of parties as subclasses of the abstract
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; class, instances of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; are made to be different because they are
composed of different parts. The advantage of using composition over inheritance
is that there is no coupling of subclasses to a superclass in composition,
reducing the number of dependencies in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delegation&quot;&gt;Delegation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delegation often comes up when composition is used. Delegation is the concept of
passing off some work to another object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be some logic involved for inviting our guests to the party, and we
could put that logic inside our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Party
  attr_accessor :venue, :guests, :supplies, :activities

  def initialize(args)
    @venue = args[:venue]
    @guests = args[:guests]
    @supplies = args[:supplies]
    @activities = args[:activities]
  end

  def invite_guests
    guests.each { |guest| invite(guest) }
  end

  def invite(guest)
    puts &quot;Hi #{guest.name}, please come to my party at #{venue}!&quot;
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we could also delegate this task to each guest by placing that logic inside
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; class and sending that message to the guest objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class User
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def send_invitation(context)
    puts &quot;Hi #{name}, please come to my party at #{context.venue}!&quot;
  end
end

class Party
  attr_accessor :venue, :guests, :supplies, :activities

  def initialize(args)
    @venue = args[:venue]
    @guests = args[:guests]
    @supplies = args[:supplies]
    @activities = args[:activities]
  end

  def invite_guests
    guests.each { |guest| guest.send_invitation(self) }
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;invite_guests&lt;/code&gt; method on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; class sends the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;send_invitation&lt;/code&gt; message to each guest, which is defined in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; class.
The instance of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; also passes a reference of itself, as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;, as an
argument to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;send_invitation&lt;/code&gt;, allowing the method to know the context in which
it should be performed. The logic of how to invite a guest has been passed off
to each guest object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-strategy-pattern&quot;&gt;The Strategy Pattern&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve discussed composition and delegation, we can use them in the
strategy pattern. Let’s Party on! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throw_party&lt;/code&gt; method from the previous post about the
template method pattern. It contains all the logic necessary for throwing a
great party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;def throw_party
  invite_guests
  buy_supplies
  clean_house
  welcome_guests
  do_activities
  kick_out_guests
  clean_house
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create variation in that algorithm by delegating the responsibilities to
the different parts that compose each party. If you remember, the only parts
that differ between birthday parties and game nights are the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;supplies&lt;/code&gt; and the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;activities&lt;/code&gt;, so I’m going to ignore the methods the deal with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;venue&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;guests&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Party
  attr_accessor :venue, :guests, :supplies, :activities

  def initialize(args)
    @venue = args[:venue]
    @guests = args[:guests]
    @supplies = args[:supplies]
    @activities = args[:activities]
  end

  def throw_party
    invite_guests
    buy_supplies
    clean_house
    welcome_guests
    do_activities
    kick_out_guests
    clean_house
  end

  def buy_supplies
    supplies.each { |supply| supply.buy }
  end

  def do_activities
    activities.each { |activity| activity.perform(self) }
  end
end

class Food
  def buy
    ...
  end
end

class Game
  def buy
    ...
  end
end

class Activity
  def perform
    ...
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;supplies&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;activities&lt;/code&gt; are the objects that compose our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;. All
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;supplies&lt;/code&gt; that make up our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; should implement the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buy&lt;/code&gt; method, whether
each object is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Game&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/code&gt;, or any other party supply. These objects all
implement a common interface, even though the implementations will likely be
different for each type of object. Similarly, all activities will implement the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;perform&lt;/code&gt; method. Without knowing the internals of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Activity#perform&lt;/code&gt;, we can
safely assume that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;perform&lt;/code&gt; method for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; object for singing
happy birthday will likely have different side effects than the one for playing
games. All of these sections of the algorithm have been delegated to the parts
of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; object that are involved in their execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy pattern solves the same problem that the template method pattern
solves, but it reduces the amount of coupling between objects by using
composition over inheritance. Instead of identifying the sections of your
algorithm that can vary and then placing those sections in subclasses of an
abstract superclass, the algorithm has been delegated to the different parts
that compose your object, and those objects implement their respective portions
of the algorithm however they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The strategy pattern is an alternative to the template method pattern I wrote about in my previous post, providing a different solution to the common programming problem of requiring some variation within an algorithm.

The goal is to learn
and grow together as software engineers. But really, sometimes it’s more like a
support group, where we use a lot of 😞, 😞, and 😢 to discuss our respective
screw-ups at work and the impossible vastness of information about web
development and how we only know the smallest tiniest minusculest amount of it.
We’re a fun group…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first book we read together was &lt;em&gt;Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby&lt;/em&gt;
by Sandi Metz. Really amazing resource for new Ruby devs (or probably any new
dev using an OO language). For our next book, we just started reading &lt;em&gt;Design
Patterns in Ruby&lt;/em&gt; by Russ Olsen, so this will be the first in a planned series
about the various design patterns discussed in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pattern is the template method pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inheritance--polymorphism&quot;&gt;Inheritance + Polymorphism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template method pattern is an object-oriented design pattern that relies on
inheritance and polymorphism. By inheritance, I am talking about the
parent-child relationship between classes, where a class can be defined as a
subclass of another and inherits all of that superclass’ methods. By
polymorphism, I am talking about the ability to invoke the same method on
multiple objects of different classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Inheritance

class Computer
  def initialize
    @on = false
  end

  def power_on
    @on = true
    puts 'Booting up...'
  end
end

class Laptop &amp;lt; Computer
  def close_lid
    ...
  end

  def open_lid
    ...
  end
end

my_laptop = Laptop.new
my_laptop.power_on          # =&amp;gt; Booting up...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the basic inheritance example above, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt; class defines the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;power_on&lt;/code&gt; method. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Laptop&lt;/code&gt; class is defined as a subclass of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt; and
also defines its own set of methods. But since &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt; is its superclass,
instances of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Laptop&lt;/code&gt; inherit the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;power_on&lt;/code&gt; method and are able to be sent that
message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Polymorphism

def too_big?(obj)
  obj.length &amp;gt; 10
end

str = 'Hello, World!'
arr = [1, 2, 3]

too_big?(str)               # =&amp;gt; true
too_big?(arr)               # =&amp;gt; false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polymorphism example is showing that both the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; classes
implement the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; method. There is some role that they are both playing,
perhaps the role of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Countable&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;too_big?&lt;/code&gt; method doesn’t care whether it
is being passed a string or an array; it just cares whether it is being passed
an object that is countable and has implemented &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;. Being able to send the
same message to objects that are instances of different classes is polymorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-template-method-pattern&quot;&gt;The Template Method Pattern&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template method pattern combines the concepts of inheritance and
polymorphism to solve the common programming problem of needing to allow for
some level of variation in an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were a strange person, you might think of your life in terms of Ruby
objects and messages that you send to these objects. So if you wanted to throw a
birthday party for your niece, you might have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; class with a
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throw_party&lt;/code&gt; method that does all the steps necessary for giving your niece a
successful birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Party
  def throw_party
    invite_guests
    clean_house
    buy_birthday_cake
    welcome_guests
    sing_happy_birthday
    kick_out_guests
    clean_house
  end

  private

  ...all the private methods being used in throw_party...

end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you wanted to throw another party, maybe a game night for you and some
friends? It would be great to reuse this &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; class and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throw_party&lt;/code&gt;
method, but while some parts of the method are general to any party, some parts
are very specific to birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could put in some conditionals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Party
  def throw_party(type)
    invite_guests
    clean_house

    if type == 'birthday'
      buy_birthday_cake
    elsif type == 'game_night'
      buy_board_games
    end

    welcome_guests

    if type == 'birthday'
      sing_happy_birthday
    elsif type == 'game_night'
      play_games
    end

    kick_out_guests
    clean_house
  end

  private

  ...all the private methods being used in throw_party...

end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes! That is not the best solution. Any time you want to throw a different
kind of party, you will have to modify this method until it grows out of
control. And you’ll have to add more and more private methods to this class. But
having completely separate classes for each party type isn’t ideal, either,
since we saw that most of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throw_party&lt;/code&gt; logic is common to any type of
party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template method pattern is a way of separating the parts that are the same
from the parts that are different. The parts that are the same get implemented
in a parent class while the parts that are different are implemented in the
subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only parts that differ between the two party types are the buying of
supplies and the party activities. So we can create an abstract Party class
(abstract because there will be no instances of it) that will serve as the
superclass for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BirthdayParty&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GameNight&lt;/code&gt; classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Party
  def throw_party
    invite_guests
    buy_supplies
    clean_house
    welcome_guests
    do_activities
    kick_out_guests
    clean_house
  end

  private

  def buy_supplies
    raise 'Not implemented: buy_supplies'
  end

  def do_activities
    raise 'Not implemented: do_activities'
  end

  ...all the other private methods being used in throw_party...

end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all the parts that are the same can stay in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;, and the parts that are
different can be defined in our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BirthdayParty&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GameNight&lt;/code&gt; classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class BirthdayParty &amp;lt; Party

  private

  def buy_supplies
    buy_birthday_cake
  end

  def do_activities
    sing_happy_birthday
  end

  def buy_birthday_cake
    ...
  end

  def sing_happy_birthday
    ...
  end
end

class GameNight &amp;lt; Party

  private

  def buy_supplies
    buy_board_games
  end

  def do_activities
    play_games
  end

  def buy_board_games
    ...
  end

  def play_games
    ...
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The superclass is the template for what happens for a party, and each subclass
implements just the parts that vary from the template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;, an error is raised for methods that
are meant to be implemented in the subclasses. This provides a clear signal to
anyone wanting to implement a new type of party that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buy_supplies&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;do_activities&lt;/code&gt; are methods that should be implemented in the new party type.
Another approach would be to implement these methods in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; with some
default behavior that the subclasses then override.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the use of inheritance and polymorphism. It is fairly clear from the
code that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BirthdayParty&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GameNight&lt;/code&gt; are both subclasses of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;. So
every method defined in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt; is also available to the subclasses. In our
example, the only publicly available method in either subclass is the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throw_party&lt;/code&gt; method defined in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/code&gt;. That’s where the polymorphism comes in.
Whatever object decides to throw a party can do so by sending the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throw_party&lt;/code&gt;
message to an instance of either &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BirthdayParty&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GameNight&lt;/code&gt;. It doesn’t care
which type of object it sends the message to, and even though the results may be
different, both types of objects will respond to the message.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A couple friends and I have a web development book club.

what type of database is best suited for your application. You might face this
decision very soon, if you are planning on building your own application as a
side project. And at the very least, you will probably be asked about databases
in a job interview for a web developer role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web applications use either relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) databases
for persistent data storage. The point of this post is to provide a simple,
high-level overviews of relational and non-relational databases, highlight their
differences and discuss scenarios in which to use each, and briefly examine
common database management systems for each. I do not claim to be a database
expert, so some of the language in this post will use generalizations. I am
always looking to learn more about databases, but I know enough to be an
effective developer, and hopefully this post will provide you with enough info
so you can make more informed decisions regarding databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relational-sql-databases&quot;&gt;Relational (SQL) Databases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relational databases, the data is stored in tables. These tables are like
Excel spreadsheets with rows and columns, except a table in a database is
generally much more strict in its structure. A row in a table represents a
single record, and the columns are the attributes for that record. For example,
we might have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog_posts&lt;/code&gt; table with various attributes for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;,
and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;date_published&lt;/code&gt;. The table will also have an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; column, which is a unique
number for each record in the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# blog_posts

| id | title       | body            | data_published |
|  1 | First Post! | blah blah...    | Feb 6, 2017    |
|  2 | Iguanas     | Yay iguanas...  | Feb 7, 2017    |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, data often has relationships with other data. That’s where
the term “relational” comes from. In our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog_posts&lt;/code&gt; example, we might want to
also want to store the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; for each blog post. We could store attributes
such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_first_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_last_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_email&lt;/code&gt;, etc. with each
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog_post&lt;/code&gt; record, but that would get very messy very fast. Plus, there’s
probably already a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; table with all that information. So instead, we can
add an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt; column to our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog_posts&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# blog_posts

| id | title       | body           | data_published | author_id |
|  1 | First Post! | blah blah...   | Feb 6, 2017    |        23 |
|  2 | Iguanas     | Yay iguanas... | Feb 7, 2017    |         5 |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt; values match up to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; values in the authors table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# author

| id | first_name  | last_name | email                 |
|  5 | David       | Mitchell  | dmitch@cloudatlas.com |
| 23 | Margaret    | Atwood    | handmaid@tales.com    |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you retrieve a blog post, you can “join” the data with the corresponding
author data by matching the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; columns from the tables.
Conversely, you can lookup an author and then “join” the blog post data to find
all the blog posts by a particular author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL stands for “structured query language,” the language used to interact with
relational databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-relational-nosql-databases&quot;&gt;Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-relational databases make up all the other types of databases that aren’t
relational databases, and NoSQL means “not only SQL.” This post will cover two
types of NoSQL databases, document stores and key-value stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;document-stores&quot;&gt;Document Stores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In document stores, the data is stored in collections, and collections are made
up of objects referred to as documents. These collections are the equivalent of
relational tables, and documents are the equivalent of records. So a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;users&lt;/code&gt;
collection would consist of documents, each one representing a different user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documents have attributes, which are defined for each collection. In the case of
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; collection, we might have attributes like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;last_name&lt;/code&gt;,
and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;. Document objects are encoded using familiar formats such as JSON,
XML, or YAML. So JSON-encoded documents might look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# users

{
    &quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;David&quot;,
    &quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Mitchell&quot;,
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;dmitch@cloudatlas.com&quot;
},
{
    &quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Margaret&quot;,
    &quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Atwood&quot;,
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;handmaid@tales.com&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document stores can also allow for relationships between documents through a
similar method as is done in relational databases, referencing another object’s
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following example, there is some redundancy, but it illustrates two ways
a relationship could be defined. In the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/code&gt; collection, documents contain
a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog_posts&lt;/code&gt; attribute which is an array of references to blog post documents.
In the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog_posts&lt;/code&gt; collection, the documents contain an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author_id&lt;/code&gt; attribute
which is a reference to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/code&gt; collection. Based on the data you are
working with, a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship could be handled with
either method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# authors

{
    &quot;id&quot;: 2,
    &quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;David&quot;,
    &quot;last_name&quot;: &quot;Mitchell&quot;,
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;dmitch@cloudatlas.com&quot;,
    &quot;blog_posts&quot;: [1, 4]
}

# blog_posts

{
    &quot;id&quot;: 1,
    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;First Post!&quot;,
    &quot;body&quot;: &quot;blah blah...&quot;,
    &quot;date_published&quot;: &quot;Feb 6, 2017&quot;,
    &quot;author_id&quot;: 2
},
{
    &quot;id&quot;: 4,
    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Iguanas&quot;,
    &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Yay iguanas...&quot;,
    &quot;date_published&quot;: &quot;Feb 7, 2017&quot;,
    &quot;author_id&quot;: 2
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some data, it may even make sense to define relationships between data by
embedding documents within documents. An example of this might be a shopping
cart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# shopping_carts

{
    &quot;user_id&quot;: 24,
    &quot;items&quot;: [{
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Black Swan Green&quot;,
        &quot;price&quot;: 15.99,
        &quot;quantity&quot;: 2
    }, {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;
        &quot;price&quot;: 24.99,
        &quot;quantity&quot;: 1
    }]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-value-stores&quot;&gt;Key-Value Stores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key-value stores are simpler than document stores and are exactly what they
sound like, key-value pairs. Like big hashes. Some key-value stores are just
string keys paired with string values. Others allow for more complex data
structures for the values, such as unordered sets of strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common use case for key-value stores in web applications is for storing user
preferences. User preferences often need to persist across user sessions, but
they may not be appropriate to be stored directly on the user record/document in
the database. Because key-value stores are generally made to be accessed
quickly, they provide a simple and fast storage solution for user preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acid-compliance&quot;&gt;ACID Compliance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important topic to discuss when comparing relational and non-relational
databases is ACID. Acid stands for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;tomicity: Transactions are performed in an “all or nothing” manner. If
one or more operations within the transaction fails, then all other operations
in the transaction will fail. A common example is a banking transaction where
money should be withdrawn from one bank account and deposited into another. If
either of those operations fail, you want the entire transaction to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;onsistency: The data can only be modified in ways that are allowed and
adhere to any and all defined constraints. An example of a constraint is that
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; attribute is limited to 100 characters. In this case, consistency
in the database means that a transaction will never result in an email with
more than 100 characters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;solation: Concurrent transactions result in the data being in a state as
if the transactions occurred one after the other. There’s a bit more to it,
but to keep it simple you can think of isolation as data being locked when it
is the target of a transaction. When data is locked, other transactions are
not operating on the data, and the data is isolated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;urability: Once a transaction is complete, the new state of the data will
persist even if a system failure or some other error occurs immediately
afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I’m speaking in generalizations, but it is commonly understood in web
development that relational databases are ACID-compliant while non-relational
databases are not fully ACID-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With full ACID compliance, there are some drawbacks. Most notably, performance
and scalability. Many NoSQL databases are designed to be more highly scalable
and faster than SQL databases, having sacrificed ACID-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deciding-between-sql-and-nosql-using-the-cap-theorem&quot;&gt;Deciding Between SQL and NoSQL Using the CAP Theorem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help you evaluate the needs of your application in order to determine if you
should use a relational or non-relational database, you can reference the CAP
Theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Jw1iFr4v58M&quot;&gt;great video explanation&lt;/a&gt; (only 4.5
minutes!) on YouTube that I recommend, but I’ll try my hand at explaining it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAP Theorem proposes that distributed database systems (“distributed”
meaning comprised of multiple nodes that communicate with each other to act as a
single system) have 3 potential attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;onsistency: When performing a “read” from one node in the system, you
always receive the most recent “write”, even if that “write” occurred on a
different node. Different than the “consistency” in ACID.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;vailability: When a request is made to a node, as long as the node has
not failed, it will respond to the request.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;artition Tolerance: When a node is removed from the system, the system
continues to operate and uphold its other attributes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the CAP Theorem also states that a distributed database system can have
a maximum of 2 of these attributes and it is theoretically impossible to have
all 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a “write” happens to one node in the system and is immediately
followed by a “read” to a different node, there are 3 possible outcomes of the
“read”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C &amp;amp; P&lt;/strong&gt;: The system is partition tolerant, so the nodes are not able to talk
to each other. The node would wait until it is able to talk to the other nodes
in order to maintain consistency before returning the data. However, since the
nodes are not able to communicate, the node would not respond to the request
and is thus not available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &amp;amp; P&lt;/strong&gt;: The system is partition tolerant, so the nodes are not able to talk
to each other. The node would maintain availability and return the most recent
version of the data that it has, even though it is not the most recent version
of the data in the system. So the node is not consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &amp;amp; C&lt;/strong&gt;: The system is not partition tolerant and can only uphold its other
attributes when all nodes are connected to the system. This means that the
node would be able to communicate with the others nodes, maintain consistency
by retrieving the most recent data, and maintain availability by responding to
the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third outcome can be dismissed because partition tolerance is an integral
aspect of distributed database systems. Therefore, the choice comes down to
consistency or availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the section on ACID, we can generalize that since ACID-compliant database
systems are less performant than non-ACID-compliant database systems, then
ACID-compliant databases are less available than non-ACID-compliant systems.
They are less available but more consistent. Conversely, non-ACID-compliant
databases are more available and less consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This choice between availability and consistency should be one of the factors
you consider when deciding between relational and non-relational databases. Is
it more important for your application to maintain very strict control over your
data, even at the cost of performance? Or is the speed of your application more
important than making sure your data is handled exactly as you expect 100% of
the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-database-management-systems&quot;&gt;Common Database Management Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a short section about the database management systems that I see
most often in job listings, web applications I’ve worked on, web applications my
friends work on, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relational&quot;&gt;Relational&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mysql.com/&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;: Very popular.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;: Implements more advanced data types
than MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mariadb.org/&quot;&gt;MariaDB&lt;/a&gt;: Community-developed fork of MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/&quot;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt;: Lightweight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-relational&quot;&gt;Non-Relational&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;: JSON-like document store.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://couchdb.apache.org/&quot;&gt;CouchDB&lt;/a&gt;: JSON document store.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt;: Key-value store. Supports strings, lists, sets,
hashes, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cassandra.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt;: “Multiple master” model for high
availability and scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/&quot;&gt;DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt;: Cloud data store from AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neo4j.com/&quot;&gt;Neo4j&lt;/a&gt;: Graph database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many web applications, the database provides the foundation upon which the
application is built. It is important to choose a database that will serve your
application and its users appropriately for the foreseeable future of your
application. However, as your application evolves, you can always re-evaluate
your database needs and migrate your data over to a new system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you go! More than you ever probably wanted to read about databases in
the context of web development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">At some point during your career as a web developer, you will have to decide what type of database is best suited for your application. You might face this decision very soon, if you are planning on building your own application as a side project. And at the very least, you will probably be asked about databases in a job interview for a web developer role.</summary></entry></feed>
