    <p>A couple weeks ago, I started learning Python. There are a few reasons I chose
Python as the next language I wanted to learn after learning JavaScript. These
were criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python is used in web development</li>
  <li>Python has true classes, unlike JS, resulting in real object-oriented
programming</li>
  <li>There are many many jobs available for Python developers</li>
  <li>The design of Python seems well thought out compared to JavaScript</li>
  <li>Python syntax and forced indentation results in neatly structured code</li>
</ul>

<p>I started my learning by delving into the Python track on
<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>. For learning new coding
concepts/technologies, I prefer learning by videos and short exercises over
using books. If you are the same, I highly suggest checking out
<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> or <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code
School</a> or any of the other similar sites. They
can be a great way to jumpstart your learning.</p>

<p>After tackling the Python track on Treehouse, I completed a smattering of
problems on both <a href="http://exercism.io/">Exercism</a> and
<a href="http://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a>. These sites are awesome for developing
strong fundamentals in a particular programming language.</p>

<p>Honestly, I still feel fairly weak in Python. But I do know the basics, and I
feel confident that I can effectively Google my way through most problems. I
also feel that I learn best when building things. How else can you come across
real world problems and find ways to solve them?</p>

<p>On Monday of this week, I decided to start a Django tutorial. I chose Django
because it is, from what I can tell, the most popular Python web framework and
it is supposed to have great documentation. I started the tutorial on the
official Django website:</p>

<p>[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/]</p>

<p>My only experience with web development is with full stack JavaScript, so the
idea of setting up my Django application was a bit daunting. Thankfully, this
tutorial walks you through every step needed to setup your first Django
application, including linking to other tutorials where it might be necessary.
There are 6 parts to the tutorial, and I have completed the first 2 parts. Here
are a few tips if you are getting started with Python and Django:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow this guide for installing Python 3 on your Mac:
[http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how-to-upgrade-your-mac-to-python-3]</li>
  <li>Follow this guide for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtualenv</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtualenvwrapper</code>:
[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/]</li>
  <li>If you have issues with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtualenvwrapper</code>, try using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easy_install</code> instead
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip3</code>. This solved a problem I had when trying to perform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source
/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh</code>.</li>
</ul>
